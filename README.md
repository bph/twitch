# Twitch Streams Code
This repo stores all of the code I create during streaming. For each stream, I'll create a branch and then merge it into `trunk` at the end and push both. That should keep things from getting too messy should. Hopefully it's useful üòé

All of the streams are also available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kRIqFHtN8ccB_mTmHyGDg)

* No code in this repos, as we updated some of the blocks in the [Gutenberg Examples](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples) repo.
* Discussed that if a block isn't using [`@wordpress/scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) for a build process, that we need to manually add the `index.asset.php` file.
* Figured out how the useBlockProps hook worked when passing items. Thanks to everyone who helped on that one!
