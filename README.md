[First steam! Let's mess with some custom blocks](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1151309353)

Here are some of the topics/highlights:
* We talked about creating blocks from scratch using [`@wordpress/scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/)
* Demonstrated the differences between Dynamic and Static blocks
* Showed how to save attributes in a block.
* Used the [`@wordpress/create-block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) package to scaffold a new block. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
* Talked about using how to get multiple blocks in a plugin ( code was never completed)
* Audio issues ðŸ˜ž
* Ryan not able to type while people watch ( recurring theme...)
* Worked with `getEntityRecords`, `isResolving`, and `invalidateResolver` to display posts in the Block Editor. Inspired by [this blog post](https://ryanwelcher.com/2021/08/requesting-data-in-gutenberg-with-getentityrecords/).
